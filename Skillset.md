&nbsp;

# BackEnd

My main BackEnd Language is Java<br>
I am proficient in using older as well as newer Versions of the JDK.<br>
<br>
The most experience I got is using Java/Jakarta Enterprise Edition.<br>
I use [Quarkus Framework](https://quarkus.io/) as well as [Wildfly Application Servers](https://www.wildfly.org/), depending on usecase.<br>
<br>
Most of the time the BackEnd is interacting with a MySQL 8 Database.<br>

Next to Web-focused Applications I wrote smaller Applications like [Discord](https://discord.com/) Bots using a Implementation of Discord's APIs called [JDA](https://github.com/DV8FromTheWorld/JDA/).<br>

# Web-FrontEnd

Next to the BackEnd Development I collected plenty of FrontEnd Experience on my way.<br>
It all started with simple HTML Pages that didn't do much and by now reached the point of complex WebApps.<br>

&nbsp;

When working with Java ServerFaces I am able to develop Full-Stack Applications without leaving the World of Java.<br>
If JSF does not solve all problems my JavaScript Skills come in handy in finding Workarounds.<br>

![JavaScript Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/JavaScript-informational?style=flat&logo=javascript&logoColor=white&color=F7DF1E)

&nbsp;

When designing UI in many cases I used some version of [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com/).<br>

![FontAwesome Shield](https://img.shields.io/badge/FontAwesome-informational?style=flat&logo=FontAwesome&logoColor=white&color=339AF0)

&nbsp;

Following modern Trends I later started my way into the world of reactive Frameworks.<br>
My candidate of choice was [Vue.js](https://vuejs.org/), focusing on Vue 3's Composition API.<br>
<br>
While diving into the deep waters of Vue Development someone told me about [Quasar Framework](https://quasar.dev/) which I learned to love.

# Servers and Deployments

Although I am developing on Windows Machines most of the time I use Linux Servers in production.<br>
I took looks into different distributions, but always came back to Ubuntu, which I use for years on Desktops and Servers.<br>
I manage my Servers fully by myself.<br>

When discovering Quarkus I started learning about Docker Containers and by now have multiple programs run on Docker.<br>

# Honorable Mentions

Next to Skills in Software Development I configured and build several PCs over the years.<br>
<br>
I used multiple IDEs, including Eclipse IDE, IntelliJ IDEA or Visual Studio Code.<br>
